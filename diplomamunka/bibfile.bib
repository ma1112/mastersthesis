  abstract={This paper is about calibration of cone-beam (CB) scanners for both x-ray computed tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography. Scanner calibration refers here to the estimation of a set of parameters which fully describe the geometry of data acquisition. Such parameters are needed for the tomographic reconstruction step. The discussion is limited to the usual case where the cone vertex and planar detector move along a circular path relative to the object. It is also assumed that the detector does not have spatial distortions. We propose a new method which requires a small set of measurements of a simple calibration object consisting of two spherical objects, that can be considered as `point' objects. This object traces two ellipses on the detector and from the parametric description of these ellipses, the calibration geometry can be determined analytically using explicit formulae. The method is robust and easy to implement. However, it is not fully general as it is assumed that the detector is parallel to the rotation axis of the scanner. Implementation details are given for an experimental x-ray CB scanner.}
